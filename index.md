- *Pioneered the adoption* of an Azure-based DevOps CI/CD workflow for Python Git repositories, streamlining testing and development processes, saving time, and reducing errors.
- *Designed and deployed* a Fire Potential Index forecast process, supporting the company's Wildfire Mitigation Plan and enhancing proactive wildfire response strategies.

`2022 - now`__Oregon Air National Guard__, Portland, OR
- *Officer in Charge* of the 123rd Combat Weather Flight, overseeing a team of 6 enlisted Weather Airmen and ensuring operational readiness.
- *Coordinated training opportunities* with Army National Guard units, enhancing inter-unit collaboration and operational integration.
- *Developed and implemented* comprehensive training protocols for Weather Airmen, aligning meteorological expertise with Army doctrine to facilitate seamless integration into joint operations.

`2008 - 2022`__Army National Guard__, Missouri, Arizona, and Idaho
- *Served 8 years* as part-time enlisted personnel and 3 years as a non-commissioned officer, demonstrating leadership, strategic planning, and operational management within various units.
- *Acting Forward Support Company Executive Officer* in the 183rd Aviation Battalion for 2 years, managing supply chain operations while ensuring mission-critical resource availability.
