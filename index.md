## Occupation


`2016 - now`__Idaho Power Company__, Boise, ID

- Led cross-departmental team to assess improved wind generation forecast's financial impact. Quantified benefits at ~$100k, enabling strategic resource reallocation.
- Created Python-based cloud seeding suspension criteria, adopted in operations (WY 2024), reducing minimum suspension period to 3 days from 30. Earned positive stakeholder feedback and inquiries for broader applications.
- Lead cross-deptarmental team to update solar and wind generation forecasts, reducing generation forecast error by ~30%, allowing for improved day-ahead resource planning.
- Pioneered Azure-based DevOps CI/CD workflow for Python git repositories at the company, streamlining testing and development, saving time and reducing errors.
- Developed and maintained 12 operational Python codes, supporting cloud seeding, renewable energy optimization, and market trade decisions.

`2022 - now`__Oregon Air National Guard__, Portland, OR

- Officer in Charge of the 123rd Combat Weather Flight which consists of 6 enlisted Weather Airmen.
- Coordinates training opportunities with Army National Guard units
- Responsible for ensuring weather airmen are trained in both weather to support Army Guard and also familiarized with Army doctrine so we can successfully integrate into their operations.

`2008 - 2022`__Army National Guard__, Missouri, Arizona, and Idaho

- Combined 8 years part-time enlisted service with 3 years as a non-commissioned officer.
- 2 years served as a logistics officer for an aviation batallion.
- 5 year break in service during Ph.D. and beginning of career at Idaho Power.
